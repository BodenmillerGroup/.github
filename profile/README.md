## Welcome to the Bodenmiller Lab Github

This organization serves the purpose to collect analysis and software repositories associated to our research. 

### Multiplexed image analysis

General instructions on how to analyse imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data can be found in the [IMC data analysis workflow](https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/IMCWorkflow/).
For general discussions and questions relating to IMC data analysis, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/IMCWorkflow/issues/new?assignees=nilseling&labels=Question&template=question_template.md&title=).

The following tools have been developed by the lab to perform multiplexed image analysis:

* [steinbock](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/steinbock) for containerized image processing and segmentation.  
* [readimc](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/readimc) for reading raw IMC data.  
* [ImcSegmentationPipeline](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/ImcSegmentationPipeline) for interactive IMC data processing and segmentation.   
* [napari-imc](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/napari-imc) for interactive visualization of IMC raw data in [napari](https://napari.org/).  
* [cytomapper](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/cytomapper) for multiplexed image visualization in R.  
* [cytoviewer](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/cytoviewer) for interactive multiplexed image visualization in R.
* [imcRtools](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imcRtools) for single-cell and spatial analysis in R.  
* [IMCDataAnalysis](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/IMCDataAnalysis) for a reproducible workflow on multiplexed image downstream analysis in R.  
* [imcdatasets](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imcdatasets) for a collection of publicly available IMC datasets in R.

Please open issues in the relevant repositories to file bug reports or feature requests.
